Transparent areas? They’ll print as white. And those soft edges or delicate textures? They might blur or bleed once ink hits cotton.<br/><br/>If you’re going for a gradient, test it on white fabric first. Keep the contrast strong, avoid fading into transparency, and use clear tonal stops to keep the details crisp.</p>",

To keep things sharp, always preview your layout using the Product Creator and make sure key elements stay clear of seams, collars, and zips – those spots can warp your design.<br/><br/>For edge-to-edge prints, your artwork should fully cover the print area, including the bleed zone. DTG prints typically begin 2–3 inches below the collar, so plan your placement accordingly. <br/><br/>And if you’re printing across a wide size range, know this: your design size stays fixed (usually based on a size L), so it may appear larger on a small tee and smaller on a big one. Design with flexibility in mind.</p>",

Understanding how each one works can save you from design mishaps and help you choose the best fit for your project.<br/><br/><strong>DTG</strong> (Direct to Garment) is ideal for small runs and intricate designs on cotton. It delivers soft-feel, full-colour prints but works best on flat, smooth areas.<br/><br/><strong>DTF</strong> (Direct to Film) is a go-to for all fabric types, with bold colour, sharp outlines, and a slightly raised finish that pops.<br/><br/><strong>Sublimation</strong> is made for edge-to-edge prints on polyester. It fuses ink into the fabric for ultra-vibrant, fade-proof colour – perfect for all-over designs.<br/><br/><strong>Screen Printing</strong> shines when you’re going big. It’s built for bulk orders, solid block colours, and long-lasting impact – ideal for merch lines and high-volume campaigns.</p>",
